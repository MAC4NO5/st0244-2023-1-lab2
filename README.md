### Explanation of our code
In this lab we implement 5 recursive primitive functions in
the Haskell programming language. We implemented functions
such as addition, multiplication, identity, double succesor
and predecessor, we decided to make use of lambda functions
for the development of these, and then test them through
QuickCheck with 100 tests that show us that our functions make
a correct application.
